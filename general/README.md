# General Development Guidelines

## Version Control Standards

### Git Workflow

- Use **[GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)** branching strategy
- **Main branch**: Production-ready code
- **Develop branch**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature branches**: `feature/TICKET-123-description`
- **Release branches**: `release/v1.2.0`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/TICKET-456-critical-fix`

### Commit Messages

Follow [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```text
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add JWT token validation`
- `fix(api): resolve null reference exception in customer service`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `refactor(core): extract customer validation logic`

### Branch Protection Rules

- Require pull request reviews (minimum 1 reviewer)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions

## Code Review Guidelines

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows established conventions
- [ ] Unit tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Markdown follows linting rules
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Security best practices followed

### Review Process

1. **Author**: Create PR with clear description
2. **Reviewer**: Provide constructive feedback
3. **Author**: Address feedback and update PR
4. **Reviewer**: Approve when satisfied
5. **Author**: Merge after approval

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Linting

Use [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) for consistent markdown formatting:

- Configuration: See [.markdownlint.json](../.markdownlint.json)
- Line length: 120 characters (code blocks and tables excluded)
- Heading style: ATX (using `#` symbols)
- List indentation: 2 spaces
- Allow specific HTML elements: `<summary>`, `<details>`, `<br>`

### README Files

Every project should include:

- Project description and purpose
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

### Code Documentation

- Document public APIs with XML comments
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Explain business logic and decisions
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### Architecture Documentation

- System overview diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- API documentation
- Deployment guides

## Development Workflow

### Definition of Done

A feature is considered done when:

- [ ] Code is complete and tested
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance testing completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed

### Environment Strategy

- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Testing**: Automated testing environment
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final testing
- **Production**: Live environment

## Security Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Fail Securely**: Ensure failures don't compromise security
- **Never Trust Input**: Validate and sanitize all input
- **Keep Security Simple**: Avoid complex security mechanisms

### Common Security Practices

- Use HTTPS for all communication
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Store secrets in secure configuration management
- Implement proper error handling (don't expose sensitive information)
- Regular security updates and patches

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for configuration
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow GDPR and other privacy regulations

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Targets

- **API Endpoints**: < 200ms for simple operations
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms for most queries
- **Page Load Times**: < 3 seconds
- **File Uploads**: Progress indication for > 5 seconds

### Performance Best Practices

- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and indexes
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Use asynchronous operations where appropriate
- Monitor application performance continuously

### Monitoring and Logging

- Implement structured logging
- Use correlation IDs for request tracking
- Monitor key performance indicators
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Regular performance reviews and optimizations
